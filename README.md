Sports Score Predictor
A simple Python project to predict sports match outcomes based on recent win/loss history using basic logic.

About
This project demonstrates a foundational approach to predicting sports scores by comparing recent match performances. Ideal as a programming beginner's guide for logic-based prediction.

Features
Predicts the winner or draw for a match between two teams

Easy to modify for more teams or other sports

How it Works
Each team’s five most recent results are entered as W/L/D values.

The logic assigns 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss.

Points are summed and compared to predict the winner.
